## What does the application do?
It's a mobile application that will allow the user to easily purchase public transport tickets via SMS.

For this particular application we will take the case of Bucharest public transport that offers 3 types of tickets that can be purchased via SMS:

1. 1 day pass – a ticket for the whole day. To buy this ticket you have to send an SMS to the number 7458 with the text “A”
2. 1 way ticket for Express line 780. To buy this ticket you have to send an SMS to the number 7458 with the text “E780”
3. 1 way ticket for Express line 780. To buy this ticket you have to send an SMS to the number 7458 with the text “E783”

To make this as easy as possible for the user the application implements one screen with 3 buttons, one for each type of ticket. When the user clicks one of the buttons the app automatically sends the SMS with the right text and therefore purchase the ticket.
